How to contribute to example

1. Did you find a bug?
a. Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
b. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


2. Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
a. Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.


3. Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
a. Suggest your change to host email and start writing code.
b. Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

4. Do you have questions about the source code?
a. Ask any question about how to use example to host email.
